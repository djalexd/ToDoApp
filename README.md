The purpose of this app is to manage my own tasks!

* Expired tasks must be marked with red.

* Tasks can be updated (by assigned to or creator). (U)
* Tasks can be deleted. (D)                (functional behavior)
* Tasks can be deleted by creator          (non-functional behavior / AOP)
* Tasks cannot be deleted by anyone else
